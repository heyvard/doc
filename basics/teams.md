# Teams

Access to a resource in NAIS is based on a label set on the resource called `team`. In the context of [Azure Active
Directory][AAD] a group is the same as a team, and you may already be part of a team that has applications on NAIS.

Every group in [AAD] has a so-called mailnick/tag, this is what NAIS generally uses to identify teams. When viewing
a group, the mailnick is the value before the `@` in the email field.

## Creating a new team

* To create a new team, make a pull request to the [teams repository] on Github
* The group's owners can manage the group using either [outlook] or [AAD]
* The following resources will be generated for the new team:

* An Azure AD group is created, and can be viewed in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ManagedAppMenuBlade/Users/appId/5cbaf0ba-4d99-48a1-acf5-cca701361fd2/objectId/4c5e3226-106e-404d-81be-d02f31104b5a)
* A [GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/navikt/teams) is created.
* Deploy keys are created, and can be obtained in the [NAIS deploy frontend](https://deploy.nais.io/).
* GCP users are provisioned, and users can log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using their NAV e-mail address.
* Two GCP projects are provisioned, one for development and one for production. See `https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=<(dev|prod)-yourteamname>`.
* Namespaces are provisioned in all Kubernetes clusters.

## Managing your team
* Team members are managed by managing the group in [AAD]

{% hint style="warning" %} It is the responsibility of each team to keep the group member roster up to date. This includes removing former team members in a timely fashion. {% endhint %}
